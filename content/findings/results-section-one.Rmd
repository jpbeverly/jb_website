## Main Findings 

Dadashazar (2017) identified factors including previous incarceration, family relations, employment and education barriers, housing constraints and substance abuse to be associated with increased recidivism. 
Hanson (2017) concluded that prior criminal history and substance abuse were among the risk factors for multiple types of recidivism across multiple types of offenders.

###Recidivism
Our team initially began looking into recidivism in Page County and the rest of Virginia. However, recidivism and even substance abuse data are scarce. Focusing on the factors of recidivism mentioned by Dadashazar (2017) and Hanson (2017) we used the incarceration and substance abuse data to visualize and compare Page County to other counties in Virginia. 

The racing incarceration rates below show that rates in Page County are relatively high compared to neighboring counties and even the state average.

Taking a closer look at the comparison of Page County incarceration rates to the average rates in Virginia, we can see that a large gap has developed since the year 2000..

#Load Data

#Select Columns
data2 <- data %>% select(yfips, year,county_name,total_prison_pop_rate)

#Calc Va Medians
med <- data2 %>% group_by(year) %>% summarise(total_prison_pop_rate=median(total_prison_pop_rate, na.rm = TRUE))
med$county_name <- "VA Median"
med$yfips <- 51

#merge medians with county data
data3 <- rbind(data2,med)

#Drop Nas
page_compare <- subset(data3, year>=1983 & year <= 2013 & county_name %in% c("Greene County", "Rappahanock County", "Warren County", "VA Median", "Page County", "Rockingham County", "Madison County", "Shenandoah County"))

## Line Graph
compare <- subset(page_compare, county_name%in%c("Page County","VA Median"))

While the substance abuse arrest data may be indicative of many factors including law and law enforcement practices, the rural areas of Virginia can be seen to have higher substance abuse arrest rates. This may be indicative of growing substance abuse problems in rural areas which is supported by other studies in the literature (Pullen and Oser, 2014; Schoeneberger et al., 2006).
